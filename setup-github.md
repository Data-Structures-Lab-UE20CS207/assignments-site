# Setting up your GitHub accounts with PES email IDs

- Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) Account with your MS Teams college email address (your email ID will be of the form **\<SRN\>@pesuonline.onmicrosoft.com** - check [PESU Academy](https://www.pesuacademy.com/Academy/) if you have forgotten)

- Create a username of the form `SRN-firstname`, where SRN is in all caps and firstname is in all lowercase. For example, if your SRN is **PES1UG20CS001** and your name is **Aman**, your username must be `PES1UG20CS001-aman`
